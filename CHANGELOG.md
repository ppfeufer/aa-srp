**This release includes all the changes from
[v1.20.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-srp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1200-alpha1---2023-06-21)
as well as the following:**

### ⚠️ Important ⚠️

#### Updating From the Alpha Version

If you by any chance installed
[v1.20.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-srp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1200-alpha1---2023-06-21)
you have to reset the migrations **before** updating to this version. This release contains
multiple migrations from the development process that have been combined.

To reset the migration from the Alpha version, run:

```shell
python manage.py migrate aasrp 0009
```

If you are unsure, you can check which migrations are applied with:

```shell
python manage.py showmigrations aasrp
```

If the last line does **not** say `[X] 0010_change_model_names_and_verobose_names`,
you are good to go. (And yes, I know, there is a typo in that migration name.)

#### Updating Process

This version has quite some changes to its database models, so please make sure to
back up your database before you update.

These database changes mean that apps which use any of this app's DB tables (e.g.:
Grafana Dashboards if you use them or [AA Fleet Pings]) will break and will need to
be updated as well. For [AA Fleet Pings] there will be a release alongside this one.

Once you have your database backed up, run the following:

```shell
pip install aa-srp==1.20.0
python manage.py migrate aasrp
```

After that, update all other apps that need to be updated following the usual process.

v0.1.0-beta.16.**

## Important Update Instructions

**IMPORTANT**

If you update from v0.1.0-beta.4 or earlier, make sure to read carefully.

In this version, the way the SRP ship is handled has changed. It is no longer just a
simple string in the database, it is now a proper EveType model. So you have to do
some extra steps to migrate your data.

**This needs to be done right after you have updated AA SRP from a version prior
v0.1.0-beta.5.**

### Step 1: Install EveUniverse

This should be done automatically with the update, but there is still a bit of
manual work to it. First you need to add the EveUniverse module to your
`INSTALLED_APPS` in your `loca.py`.

- Add `"eveuniverse",` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

### Step 2: Static Collection and Migration

Now that EveUniverse is installed, you need to run the static collection and
migration. Remember to restart your supervisor afterward.

```shell
python manage.py collectstatic
```

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth

### Step 3: Import Ship Information From ESI

This is where the magic happens. You're now ready to import the ship information
from ESI.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_load_eve
```

### Step 4: Migrate Your SRP Data

Now that we have all the needed information, your SRP data needs to be updated. This
is just another simple command.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_update_db_relations
```
